### This is a simple persian website project with only one page. it helped me learn `TailwindCSS`, `Swiper.js`, `ScrollReveal.js` and i finished it at **March 20, 2024** . 

## What i Learned : 
- `TailwindCSS` : it's not a library it's a **Development Tool** that compile utility classes into CSS code, it optimize the CSS size, makes refactoring styles faster, and keeps the code reusable. learn more about 
[TailwindCSS version 3](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/)

- `Swiper.js`: A library that offers modern and optimized sliders, running smoothly on any device. learn more about [Swiper.js version 11](https://swiperjs.com/).

- `ScrollReveal.js` : A simple and lightweight library for handling `entrance effects` when an element enters the view port it applies a motion effect to it .
